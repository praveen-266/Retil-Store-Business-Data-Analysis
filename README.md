# Retail Store Data Project

This repository contains the analysis of a dataset from a retail store in the United States. The dataset consists of 9994 records with 13 attributes.

## Introduction
- The project analyzes a dataset of sales orders from a retail store.
- The dataset contains 9994 records with 13 attributes.

## About the Project
- This project is part of the Data Science and Business Analytics internship program provided by The Sparks Foundation.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights and understand the data.

## Dataset
- The dataset is provided by The Sparks Foundation as part of Task #3 in the GRIP December-2021 Program.
- It consists of 9994 rows and 13 columns.

## Features (Columns)
- The dataset contains 13 columns representing various attributes of sales orders, including shipment mode, customer type, location, sales price, discount, and profit amount.

## Descriptive Summary
- Descriptive statistics are performed on numeric columns to gain insights into the dataset.
- Maximum sales, quantity, and profit are analyzed, as well as average values and minimum quantities.
- The average profit per order is calculated, along with maximum and minimum profit amounts.

## Data Visualization
- Data visualization techniques using seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot libraries are applied.
- Visualization operations are performed to understand the distribution and relationships between attributes.
- Modes of shipment and customer types are visualized using countplots.
- Top and worst performing cities, states, postal codes, and regions are identified and visualized.
- Sales, profit, and discount distributions are analyzed using various plots.

## Insights and Exploration
- Specific questions are answered using data frame operations and visualization techniques.
- The number of states covered in the United States is determined, along with the popular and least popular modes of shipment.
- Types of customers and their impact on profits and losses are analyzed.
- The percentage and number of sales orders that ended in a loss are calculated.
- Top 50 sales orders with massive losses are identified and reasons for the losses are discussed.
- Profit and loss analysis by product categories and sub-categories is performed.
- Pairwise relationships between attributes are explored using pair plots.
- Strategies to increase sales orders and improve profits are suggested.

## Recommendations
- The analysis suggests reducing high discount values to decrease losses and increase profits.
- Improving customer experience, implementing sales and marketing techniques, and targeting cities with fewer sales orders can help increase business profits.
- Further analysis can be performed considering additional data such as profit margin and cost price.
